In this project, I aim to apply several methodologies in order to explore the new emerging task of Key Point Analysis (KPA). 
Given a dataset of arguments and keypoints, together with labels assessing their relative correspondence and stances assessing their position towards the talked topic, 
the goal is to produce a succinct list of scored keypoints matching arguments.
